# JNMaps

This is a sample project for React Native Maps for the React Native Jax user group and JaxNode UG.

To run this in Android, you will need to use a simulator that has Google Play Services installed. 
You will also need to create an API Key for Android Google Maps in the API Console.

You will place that key in the AndroidManifest.xml file in the Application element;

```
<meta-data
        android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
        android:value="Your Google maps API Key Here"/>
```

For Demo used for May 17th 2017.
